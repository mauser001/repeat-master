## What it's about

This is a simple app to learn different subjects by repeating them until you have them correct. 

As I mainly created it for my son, I only added the units he currently needs to learn. 

If you have want to add more units feel free to create a Pull/Feature Request or reach out to me via [X](https://x.com/AlexMaushammer).
